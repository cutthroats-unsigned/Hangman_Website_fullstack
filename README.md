# cs_320_srs_hangman

A brief description about the project:
This software is a web implimentation of the basic and fun Hangman game. The game will include a database of words that will be used when
a player plays the game on their own.
if there are two people playing the game, there will be an option to allow one of the users input a word that the other user has to guess.
A player has 6 failed attempts before they lose and the man gets hanged. User's will also be able to add new words to the database if the 
word doesn't already exist.
